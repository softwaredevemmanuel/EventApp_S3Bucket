            <h5 class="tm-text-primary">Task :</h5>
            For an MVP, I Built and deployed, this product in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript :
            
            <ol>
                <li>- It Has an admin Login (use 'admin' & 'admin' as email and password for the admin user)</li>
                    
                <li>- Admin can create a new event.</li>
                <li>- Every event has a name, location & poster image attached to them.</li>
                <li>- Every event  has an event date and a bookings end date (date when bookings would end)</li>
                <li>- A New event has a type : either be free or paid.</li>
                <li>- Free events have no space limits or price attached to them</li>
                <li>- Paid events have a price and space capacity.</li>
                <li>- All these are specified before an event is created.</li>
                <li>- Admin can see ALL EVENTS</li>
                <li>- Admin can edit each event : Admin can only edit, if the event date has not passed; Admin can change the end date for ticket booking and date of the event. Admin can't change the type. For Paid events, you can increase the space capacity. You can only reduce the space capacity if and if only the number of bookings have not reached the number you are reducing it to. You can cancel an event if and if only NOBODY has booked.</li>
                <li>- Admin can view each event and see basic insight like how many people have viewed, how many people have booked, for paid events : how much they have made, how many slots are left.</li>
        
            </ol>
